    ### Problem:
    Event organizers often struggle to track attendee sentiment in real time, relying on delayed surveys and manual monitoring of social media and feedback channels. Negative experiences‚Äîsuch as long queues, poor audio quality, overcrowding, or dissatisfaction with speakers‚Äîoften go unnoticed until after the event, leading to missed opportunities for immediate intervention.

    ### Our Solution:
    We‚Äôve built an AI-powered real-time sentiment monitoring and issue detection system tailored for event organizers and product teams.

    *Key features include:*
    - *Live Sentiment Analysis:* Instantly classifies user feedback into Positive, Neutral, or Negative using NLP models.
    - *Critical Issue Detection:* Identifies keywords indicating problems like crashes, lag, bugs, or poor usability.
    - *Instant Notifications:* Triggers WhatsApp alerts to notify admins of critical user issues in real time.
    - *Integrated Feedback & QnA Module:* Collects both subjective and structured feedback through forms.
    - *Scalable Architecture:* Lightweight, modular design using FastAPI and Streamlit for future integrations.
