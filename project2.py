    ### Problem:
    Event organizers often struggle to track attendee sentiment in real time, relying on delayed surveys and manual monitoring of social media and feedback channels. Negative experiences‚Äîsuch as long queues, poor audio quality, overcrowding, or dissatisfaction with speakers‚Äîoften go unnoticed until after the event, leading to missed opportunities for immediate intervention.
    With multiple feedback sources like social media, in-app chats, live Q&A sessions, and review platforms, manually aggregating and analyzing sentiment is inefficient and inaccurate. Organizers need an AI-driven system to detect and respond to concerns as they arise, ensuring a seamless event¬†experience.

    ### Our Solution:
    We‚Äôve built an AI-powered real-time sentiment monitoring and issue detection system tailored for event organizers and product teams.

    #Key features include:

    #Live Sentiment Analysis:
     Feedback is analyzed instantly using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like VADER. It classifies responses as Positive, Neutral, or Negative to help you gauge overall public sentiment.

    #Critical Issue Detection:
     Our system scans feedback for urgent issue-related keywords (like "crash," "not working," "slow," "useless" etc.). It doesn‚Äôt just tell you how users feel ‚Äî it tells you what‚Äôs going wrong.

    #Instant Notifications:
     If any critical issue is detected, an automated WhatsApp alert is triggered and sent to the admin or operations team. This helps you act immediately, rather than waiting for post-event surveys or escalations.

    #Integrated Feedback & QnA Module:
    Users can submit detailed feedback as well as answer a structured QnA form. This allows collection of both subjective feedback and objective product performance insights.

    #Scalable Architecture:
     Built using FastAPI and Streamlit, the platform is modular, lightweight, and can be easily integrated with social media APIs, ticketing tools, or customer support platforms.

    With this platform, you can stop reacting after the damage is done ‚Äî and start responding while it‚Äôs happening.
